Building QR Code Reader & Generator with RSA Encryption Implementation


QR Code Scanner Android app that takes QR code as input from the user and generates the encrypted and decrypted output by RSA Implementation which is displayed in Text View within the Screen.

Building a QR Code Generator Android application:

1. The app will have a straightforward interface to want input and button which might help us    take the input data and send it to the QR code generator.
2. The QRGenerator Library is utilized to induce the QR code, the code will take any valid string or int data and convert that to a QR code.
3. Now we'll take the QR code data and convert that to string and set to Image view, where the generated QR code is presented the user.

Building a QR Code Reader Android application With Rsa Encryption:

1. The QR Code scanner library is used with a built-in camera API of android. To use the camera in our app we wish to boost the camera permission from the user.
2. Once the QR code is read by the camera, it'll decode the QR code image and display the decrypted & encrypted specified Text View within the screen.
3.The Rsa encrypted with the help of ascii are visiting be shown on screen after reading barcode and it will also show the decrypted result.

Libraries Used:
1. QRGenerator
2. Code-Scanner

Platform:
Android Studio

Language:
Java
